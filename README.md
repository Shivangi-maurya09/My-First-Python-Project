# School Management System

A Python-based school management system for managing student and teacher information. This application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** and a backend database implemented using **SQLite**. The project allows users to log in as either students or teachers and access relevant sections for managing records.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for backend logic and UI.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database to store and manage student and teacher records.
- **Tkcalendar**: A calendar widget for selecting dates in the Tkinter GUI.

## Features
- **Student Login**: Allows students to log in and view their personal details.
- **Teacher Login**: Allows teachers to log in and manage student records.
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLite to store user data, including students and teachers.
- **Date Selection**: Integrated calendar for date selection in the student and teacher management forms.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have **Python 3** installed. You will also need the following Python libraries:
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
